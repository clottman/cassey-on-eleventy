Most of the tweets embedded in this article are threads; click them if you want more of my in-the-moment thoughts.

## Fredd K Schott on Pika Package Manager

<blockquote>
@fredkschott at #nejsconf going through the history of modules and bundling, and points out: we added tooling on the web to access npm. That had (has!) consequences.

tweet from me on August 9, 2019

I had heard about [Pika](https://www.pika.dev/) before, but was very fuzzy on the details. Pika has a search engine and CDN for "modern web packages", and also something called Pika Web that lets you import JavaScript modules in the browser, without needing a build step for your site. 

From the docs:
 
> @pika/web installs npm packages as single .js files to a new web_modules/ directory.

This seems like potentially a convenient solution to the problem of how to install one or two packages from `npm` in a simple way in a Glitch project, that is easily consumable by a website. The creator of Pika (and giver of the talk) has an example using @pika/web on Glitch already `https://glitch.com/~pika-web-example-simple`! 

Looking at it more closely, I'm not 100% sure on the merits of using Pika over my usual approach for Glitch projects of remixing my favorite Parcel starter `https://glitch.com/~parcel`, but it is always good to have options! 

## Home Automation
<blockquote>
Next up is a talk from @codefoodpixels. He was nice enough to post slides ahead of time. #nejsconf

This was a nice little talk on home automation and hardware hacking for JavaScript developers. 

## Storytelling in Tech

<blockquote>
@ashbzak at #nejsconf giving highlights of metaphors from her best talks, in her talk today on storytelling. &quot;Firefighters are more exciting than fire marshals,&quot; she says, but &quot;you can&#39;t be a hero if you started the fire.&quot;

I appreciated this talk on how the elements of storytelling can go in to making a conference talk great. Since I don't give a ton of talks at this point, I would have liked to see some tips on how I can use storytelling in regular (smaller scale!) presentations in the workplace, but it was still a great talk.

## Responsible JavaScript
<blockquote>
@malchata talking about Responsible JavaScript. I&#39;m learning certain Babel transforms are really expensive, even &quot;simple&quot; things like default arguments in function signatures. Doing those a lot affects your bundle size. #nejsconf

tweet from me on August 9, 2019
</blockquote> 

This talk is based on a series for A List Apart ([Responsible Javascript Part 1](https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-1/) and [Responsible Javascript Part 2](https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-2/)). It was about how developers have a responsibility to make sure we're only shipping the code we really need to our users, to account for things like slow connections, data caps, and slow/non "top of the line" devices. 

The talk went into some techniques for creating smaller bundles and more performant JavaScript, but I'd like to read the accompanying articles to get more info on this. 

This talk made me realize more deeply why as an advocate for marginalized users, I should also care a lot about performance of the sites I help build.

## Web Assembly
<blockquote>@nodebotanist: &quot;I love JavaScript. It is the cockroach of languages. It&#39;s probably going to live through web assembly.&quot; #nejsconf

tweet from me on August 9, 2019
</blockquote>

This talk was a great introduction to Web Assembly, a tool that I've heard a lot about but never really understood. My takeaway is that Web Assembly is a compile target for the web, and browsers will support Web Assembly and that lets you write code in lots of other languages, which you compile to the Web Assembly target and ship to the browser. I'd like to see more about what the toolchains for doing so look like, and understand more about the effects on the user. (Can you view source to see what Web Assembly code is running, or is it all hidden away?)

## Generate Art Everywhere, And Fast

This talk was a delightful introduction to what generative web art is and how people create it. It mentioned both raw approaches like manipulating `<canvas>` elements as well as libraries like p5.js that can help you make generative art. The talk included several Glitch project links so you could see the code that was running and remix them to experiment yourself. You can find those generative art demos/starters on Glitch.com. `https://glitch.com/@trentmwillis/nejs-generative-art-demos`. 

The talk wasn't just about art though - it also touched on some principles for making your art perform quickly (using Web Workers) and appear snappily (using Offscreen Canvas). Offscreen Canvas is a newer API and it can be kind of confusing, so the talk giver (Trent M Willis `https://glitch.com/@trentmwillis`) has created [a package to make it simple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ez-offscreen-canvas) as well as a demo Glitch app that uses that package `https://glitch.com/~offscreen-canvas-kit`. 

## Tatiana Mac on Privilege

<blockquote>
@TatianaTMacending the day on a high note at #nejsconf by calling out the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy that led to the makeup of who is in this room. 👏👏👏 

tweet from me on August 9, 2019
</blockquote> 

This was a very good talk on the intersecting nature of privilege and how it affects our lives as developers and as humans. When the video comes out, y'all should watch it. 
Another good thing to read to learn from Tatiana is "[Canary in a Coal Mine: How Tech Provides Platforms for Hate](https://alistapart.com/article/canary-in-a-coal-mine-how-tech-provides-platforms-for-hate/)".

## Jokes

<blockquote>This bird has a lot of feelings to share about package managers. #nejsconf

<blockquote>I&#39;m at #nejsconf but they let in a few folks that prefer Python.
