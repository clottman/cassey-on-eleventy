[Cassey](https://cassey.dev) is a Community Health Engineer at [Glitch](https://glitch.com), keeping it the friendly place to create the app of your dreams. She once [ran for City Council in Lincoln, Nebraska](http://casseyforcouncil.com).

This site is for things she learned, inspired by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).  It was built with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.io) starting from the [11ty Base Blog project on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~11ty-eleventy-base-blog), ported to Glitch by Cassey but originally [created by Zach Leatherman, hosted on Github](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). She [copied code from Hawksworks to learn to use Sass on Github](https://www.hawksworx.com/blog/keeping-sass-simple-and-speedy-on-eleventy/). The SCSS files came from Cassey's main site, https://cassey.dev. 

[The original home of Cassey's TILs](https://github.com/clottman/til) is on Github.
