<p>I've dove into Android development recently at work, and have found that theming all the various components seems more complicated than I'm used to in good ol' CSS.</p>
<p>Luckily, I've discovered that there are tools out there for Android similar to Bootswatch which let developers generate styles for many of the basic native UI components. A developer can generate all the assets necessary to use custom colors in their app in a way that's internally consistent, as well consistent with Android Material or Holo design standards.</p>
<p>Some cool tools I found include:</p>
<p><a href="http://android-holo-colors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Holo Colors</a> - Create many of the basic UI widgets in a color of your choosing</p>
<p><a href="https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Asset Studio</a> - Generate icons in all the sizes you need for the launcher, action bar, notifications, etc. on various devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://jgilfelt.github.io/android-actionbarstylegenerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Action Bar Generator</a> - Though deprecated, you (like me!) may still be using the action bar.</p>
