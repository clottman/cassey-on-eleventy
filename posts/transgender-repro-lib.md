Susan Stryker writes in Transgender History that transgender liberation has a lot in common with reproductive liberation: one goal is securing access to medical services for a nonpathological need that not all people share and which can be quite stigmatized.

In both cases the decision to seek care is deeply personal and often emotionally weighty.

These similarities from movements people think of as distinct were apparent as far back as the 1970s. We can see them so clearly now, as the Nebraska legislature considers a ban on abortion at 12 weeks gestation and a ban on medical care for trans minors in a single bill. #neleg

Of course, it's not just the goals that create similarities in repro and trans liberation movements. It's also the reason liberation is needed: rigid enforcement of gender roles and hierarchies of power in mainstream cisnormative, heteronormative patriarchal society.
