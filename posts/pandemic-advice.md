As I have mentioned before, I [read a lot of advice columns](/advice-column-recs/). Here are a few I've read that are especially useful right now.

## Feelings

- ["How Not to Tank Your Relationship in Quarantine"](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/how-maintain-your-relationship-quarantine/608830/) by John Tierney and Roy F. Baumeister. Great tips on keeping your relationships strong if you're suddenly spending many more hours a day together than you usually do.
- ["'I Can't Stop Worrying About The Entire World'"](https://askpolly.substack.com/p/i-cant-stop-worrying-about-the-entire) by Heather Havrilesky. What to do if you're facing overwhelming anxiety right now.
- ["Being Single Really, Really Sucks Right Now"](https://holapapi.substack.com/p/being-single-really-really-sucks) by John Paul Brammer. I'm not single, but seeing a lot of single folks on twitter vouch for the goodness of this advice.
- ["How Do I Deal With My Pandemic Guilt?](https://holapapi.substack.com/p/how-do-i-deal-with-my-pandemic-guilt) by John Paul Brammer. For if you're grieving the things you're missing out on because of the pandemic, particularly big milestones like college graduation.
- ["How do I help my friends? & social-distancing for extroverts"](https://captainawkward.com/2020/03/17/corvid-19-update-questions-1258-how-do-i-help-my-friends-and-1259-social-distancing-for-extroverts/) by Captain Awkward. Good advice on offering aid to friends who have it worse, and on maintaining connections with others & keeping anxiety at a minimum.

## Logistics

- ["Hosting Troll-free/Playful/Interactive Virtual Events with Zoom"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLRrnm6g5YvD8QRSPwwNWq6NPk9FYvMpZPy_XEyOmMM/preview). A comprehensive guide to the controls available to meeting hosts in Zoom, and best practices for hosting nice virtual events.
- ["How do we make remote meetings not suck"](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/05/how-do-we-make-remote-meetings-not-suck/) by Chelsea Troy. I have learned SO MUCH about remote meeting facilitation from Chelsea. The piece linked here has the action items; the two pieces that came first in the series are also very helpful background info framing why the action items are what they are.
- ["Therapy by Phone or Video Chat Kinda Sucks. Here's How to Make It Better"](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqped/video-phone-therapy-coronavirus-quarantine) by Caitlin Flynn.
