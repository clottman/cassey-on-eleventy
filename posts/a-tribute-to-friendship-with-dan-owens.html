  "Cowboy Dan" Owens and I were an unlikely pair, but he was my best friend.
</p>
<p>
  At the high school basketball game where I met Dan, I was quietly sitting in
  the bleachers with some friends, several empty rows between us and the court.
  I was a nerdy teenager who had never done farm work. I grew up living inside
  the village limits of Diller, Nebraska, population 300. My family were all
  business owners in blue-collar industries in our small town. I wanted to be a
  journalist some day, or maybe an entrepreneur like my parents and
  grandparents.
</p>
<p>
  It was just two friends and I in our group at the beginning of the game, and
  it was a bit of a slow night. My friend Sarah decided to summon her childhood
  friend Dan to the game via text, a sure bet to liven things up. Dan turned up
  in straight-legged blue jeans and a cowboy hat. He always had on either a
  pearl-snap button-down or a cut-off T-shirt. I can’t remember which he wore
  that night, but it was surely one of the two. Dan and a couple other new
  friends walked up to us in the bleachers, looked at the game, and said,
  snowball fight?
</p>
<p>
  He carried a pair of pliers at all times and liked riding motorcycles and
  working on his truck. He and his dad weren't rich by any stretch of the
  imagination. They lived outside Washington, Kansas, thirty miles from Diller.
</p>
<p>
  I was a sophomore in high school and a member of a regional underage drinking
  prevention board; Dan was a bit older and loved to party. I was cautious; he
  loved the thrill of whipping his truck around on a dirt road and hearing the
  screams of the many ladies he brought along for the ride.
</p>
<p>
  We went out to the parking lot and started shoveling armfuls of snow at each
  other from the several inches on the ground. That was the first of many times
  Dan would transform a whole evening with his presence.

  Dan and I became best friends. He is my model of what being a caring friend
  looks like. He'd answer the phone or show up in his truck any hour of the day
  if you needed help. He joked that he'd come even if you needed a toothpick at
  midnight, and one night a friend took him up on it. It was her way of saying
  she needed his help dealing with a difficult emotional issue, and he showed up
  and offered his support.
</p>
<p>
  Dan taught me to country swing dance in my parents' basement and the Pla-Mor
  Ballroom on Sunday nights, an hour away outside of Lincoln. He was always a
  charmer, and taught me to not be afraid of asking a guy to dance. A few years
  later, I met a boyfriend on the dance floor that way, a "city-slicker" from
  Lincoln who opened me up to the world of progressive nerds like me in Lincoln.

  Dan and I continued to be close as he went off to trade school and I moved to
  Lincoln for college and joined the community of tech kids and hipsters. Dan
  became like a member of my family. He helped my dad with construction projects
  and was a laser screed operator at my grandpa's concrete company. He became
  close friends with my aunt and her fiance, a mechanic at the same company.
</p>
<p>
  My aunt and uncle were ultimately among the last people to see Dan before he
  was found dead on November 9, 2014 in Wymore, Nebraska. He'd been out at the
  bar with them, and had seemed fine when they left. A few days later after a
  frantic search, he was found in a stranger’s garage across town, their van
  left running with the doors closed. Dan was a mechanic; he would have known
  better. Some people suspected foul play; I might be one of them. He was 23.
  Dan didn't deserve to die so young. He was a good friend, a good guy, a
  beautiful soul taken too young.
</p>
<p>
  Dan had been missing a few days when I got a call from my dad to tell me that
  they’d found his body. I remember crumpling to the floor in the lobby of my
  dorm where I took the call. Tears started streaming down my face; I couldn’t
  speak. My boyfriend drove me to Diller, where we sat grieving in my aunt and
  uncle’s living room with many others who had loved Dan. I tumbled deeper into
  depression and didn't emerge for months.
</p>
<p>
  With Dan gone, I've lost a key connection to the rural area where I grew up.
  I'm only an hour away on the highway, but much farther away culturally and
  socially. I hang out at the hipster bars with vegan friends and go to
  progressive rallies and protests. My friends drink craft beer and are more
  likely to be artists than construction workers. Not many listen to the red
  dirt country music Dan introduced me to; even fewer like to hunt.
</p>
<p>
  Dan had a way of bridging the gap so that none of that mattered. He was my
  friend unconditionally, even as my politics and interests changed and there
  were more miles separating us. We found common ground in our shared struggles
  with chronic pain, our love of country swing dancing, and our desire to make
  the world a better place through relationships with those around us. I haven't
  danced much since he's been gone. Don't hang out with many biker dudes much
  any more, either.
</p>
<p>
  I know in my bones the world needs more people like Dan, people who are kind
  and honest and unafraid to be a true friend to people who are different than
  them. Dan was pure and good. He felt it was his duty to put a smile on the
  face of everyone he met, regardless of their background. He took loyalty to
  friends seriously, and was willing to make sacrifices to help others. It never
  occurred to either Dan or I that we should stop being friends because our
  political outlooks were different, or because I gravitated towards the city
  while he settled down (as much as he ever would) in Diller.
</p>
<p>
  Our increasingly divided world needs more of this type of friendship, and more
  people like Dan. It is a rare gift, and one that maybe just falls into place
  and can’t be manufactured on purpose. When it happens, though, it’s magical.
