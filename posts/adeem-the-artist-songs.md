**["Going To Heaven"](https://adeemtheartist.bandcamp.com/track/going-to-heaven-2)** is a short and sweet, irreverent lil ditty. 

**"Going to Hell"** is a pretty fun song for a road trip sing-along, but to really get the full experience, you need to see it performed live by Adeem. Adeem will instruct the crowd at how to participate before launching in to the song. When Adeem sings "Do you want to go to heaven, when we get this rapture started?", the crowd should scream "NO!". And in the next line when Adeem sings "or do you wanna go to hell, with Adeem the Artist", the crowd should yell, as nonchalantly as possible and ideally accompanied with a wholeheartedly half-hearted shrug "..okay!"

**"I Wish You Would've Been A Cowboy"** is one of Adeem's more well known songs, though I don't think you'll hear it on country radio any time soon. The experience they sing about, of having grown up on country radio in the late 90s/early 2000s, and having that being such a big part of childhood and the culture you see as "yours", and realizing once grown that a lot of it was pretty messed up, actually, really resonates with my experience. 

**"Live Forever"** is haunting, mournful, beautiful, so queer. I love it. 

**"Reclaim My Name"** is a song of gender transition, of childhood shame and reclaiming the wholeness that was deserved all along. 
> "I’ve been trying to build a machine
> That can convert shame into celebration
> I’ll go back in time and reclaim my name"

**"Fervent for the Hunger"** is so dang catchy. I just love the imagery in the lyrics, of God holding out a basket of scones and other treats, and yet there is nothing Adeem can eat. (Gluten intolerance as theology??)

**"I Never Came Out"** is one of those songs that epitomize what I love about Adeem the Artist: they are just so painfully earnest. As a self-identified "rainbow-loving boy" as mentioned in the song, who has not really came out and now finds myself married to a woman, this song doesn't map to my experience exactly but I definitely see some parallels! 

**"Pandemic Days"** captures the early covid pandemic vibe so well. It's definitely of a moment, but it's catchy, and it mixes lightness and levity ("I color in a book, dye my hair, garden for a while each day") with signature earnestness about the pain that lives alongside - "I'm afraid my folks are gonna die".

**"Tiger Prince of Knoxville"** is one of my toddler's favorite Adeem the Artist songs. In fact I just put it on and she giggled and said "mine!".  My partner sang it to her for months as a slow, a capella bedtime lullaby. (Typically slower than the actual song which is quite upbeat). She learned to sing it herself only shortly after mastering classics like Twinkle Twinkle or the ABCs. You ever heard a two year old sing words like "hillbilly royalty" or every syllable of "Tennessee"? Melts your dang heart.

**"Born in a Weigles"** is another of my kid's favorites but she's more hot & cold about it. Sometimes it's in the favorites rotation, and sometimes it's not. It's pretty silly though - I think Adeem should make a kids' album some day, with Tiger Prince and this one leading off the list, of course.

**"Asheville Blues"** has a long spoken word intro on the recording, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine when I am in a music listening mode. Otherwise though, it's notable to me because we heard Adeem sing it live in Lawrence, Kansas, which I suspect shares many of the qualities of Asheville that are being described/perhaps mocked in the song, and it fell completely and totally flat to the Lawrence audience, which was honestly pretty funny. 

The first time I ever heard Adeem the Artist, they were opening for the Mountain Goats at a venue in Omaha, Nebraska. And I was really into the music that had been played up to that point, and the very overtly progressive/lefty/irreverent vibes of the songs that had been played. And then they played **"Middle of a Heart"** and while it was incredibly moving, it also made me feel very afraid. We were in Omaha but still in Nebraska after all, and can someone really just get up on a stage in front of a whole crowd of people and sing about a traumatized American soldier's suicide post-deployment, and not get themself or the whole place shot up by someone who objects to confronting that reality? 

**"Run This Town"** is a swingy anthem for everyone who has ever fantasized with friends about doing a questionably-hostile takeover of their neighborhood association, city government, etc. Obviously, I love it. 

**"Carolina"** is one of my favorites from the White Trash Revelry album, which is saying something because I love pretty much every song on that album. I love the cadence and flow of so many verses. 

**"For Judas"** is a beautiful and sad gay love song. 

**"Heritage of Arrogance"** is one of Adeem's more in-your-face earnest political songs, grappling with how "Mom and Dad tried to teach me wrong from right, but their compasses were bad."

> We were not taught the world was so goddamn unjust
> but it’s on us to make it right.

**"Painkillers & Magic"** speaks to the legacy in Adeem's family of drug addiction and charismatic spirituality with grace and mourning. 

**"Baptized in Well Spirits"** is another song playing with the interplay between Southern Christianity and a heavy drinking culture that offers another version of salvation. 

**"Books & Records"** is about falling on hard times but carrying on the hope that things will turn around. 

> We've been selling off our books and records, 
> instruments our grandparents played
> We've been selling off our books and records,
> but we're gonna buy them back some day

The earnest pain expressed in **"My America"** really resonates with me, as another
