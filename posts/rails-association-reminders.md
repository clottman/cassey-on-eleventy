## belongs_to gets the database column
For a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, the side with the `belongs_to` is the one where the database column (`other_model_id`) goes. 

Add the migration on an existing table like this:
```ruby
def change
  add_reference :things, :other_thing
end
```
`add_reference` is aliased `add_belongs_to`. It will add an index by default. 

## has_one and has_many don't get a database column
Because it's on the belongs_to, get it?
