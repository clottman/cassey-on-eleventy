**Updated 2025-09-02:** Added Wike, Burley Hopper, Specialty Cargo Add-ons section

I can haul a lot of stuff on my cargo bikes (one front bucket style, one midtail; both electric), but I'm always interested in ways to haul even more when necessary. 

In particular, I'm curious about how I might be able to haul the front-loader home with the midtail, should the front-loader break down somewhere. Currently, we'd need to go rent a truck or call a tow truck to get that bike home. (It is 100 pounds, and not going to fit in our car!)

Here are some options for cargo trailers for bikes that I've considered. None of these are affiliate links or benefit me in any way.

## [Burley Flatbed](https://burley.com/collections/bike-cargo-trailers/products/flatbed)
The cheapest item on my list, the [Burley Flatbed](https://burley.com/collections/bike-cargo-trailers/products/flatbed) was $300 on 2024-01-15. It can carry up to 100 pounds and has two wheels. At 32 inches long though (82 centimeters), it's not going to help much with the bucket bike.

## [Burley Hopper](https://burley.com/en-ca/collections/bike-cargo-trailers/products/hopper-bike-trailer-wagon)
New from Burley, the Hopper can be used as a cargo trailer and also a wagon you push. You can put a cushion in it and have a kid ride in it in stroller mode, but not while biking. (Burley makes lots of other trailers for kid-hauling while biking, though.) It's got a 100 pound weight capacity and 115 liter volume. $800 USD as of 2025-09-02. 

## [Bikes at Work](https://www.bikesatwork.com/)
A company from Ames, Iowa (practically local!!) called [Bikes at Work](https://www.bikesatwork.com/) makes some trailers that are much longer. 

These trailers include: 
- 32 inch model for $1200
- 64 inch model for $1450
- 96 inch model for $1700. 

The frames of each trailer is modular, so you can shorten it, or purchase an extension kit later if you get a smaller one but realize you need 96 inches of space later. Or, you can make your 96 inch trailer into a 32 inch or 64 inch bed by taking out parts! They each are advertised as supporting 300 pound loads. 

Shipping to my location in Nebraska was under $100 for the 64" - 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUoXtFs3WbI) I was [sent on Mastodon](https://ohai.social/@dr2chase/111750604366497824) shows someone hauling an Urban Arrow on one of their 64" long, Wide models. 

[This person](https://mastodon.social/@graham_freeman/111751340431572129) had a 96AWD for a while and hauled many things. [More photos](https://mastodon.social/@graham_freeman/111751581714544219). 

[This person](https://social.coop/@jimkreft/111752117616528265) suggests increasing stability for carrying a box bike, but has carried many other heavy & unwieldy things successfully. 

[This person's bike co-op uses one](https://a2mi.social/@akgood/111756451322042278). 

## [Surly Bill Trailer](https://surlybikes.com/parts/bill_trailer)
The [Surly Bill Trailer](https://surlybikes.com/parts/bill_trailer) comes in at $815, with two wheels, a 63" x 24" cargo area, and a 300 pound weight limit. This looks like a really nice option. 

EXCEPT maybe the hitch won't work with my Tern bike? I don't know all the words here, but this Q&A answer seems like no. 

> I'm sorry to say but our trailer hitch is not compatible with thru axles. The mounting options include a 135 - 141 mm QR with our axle, our axle nuts that bolt directly to our dedicated dropouts such as the Troll, Ogre and ECR, or could also be used with a bolt-on / solid axle hub.

A [mastodon user](https://octodon.social/@kg6gfq/111762579622875105) points out the Surly trailers are sold without a hitch, and the hitch assembly (an additional $325) is perhaps less universal than the Bikes at Work hitches. 

## [Carla Cargo](https://www.stileproducts.com/collections/carla-cargo)

These [Main Carla Cargo page](https://www.carlacargo.de/products/) trailers are the priciest at $4,000 USD from [a random US seller I found](https://www.stileproducts.com/collections/carla-cargo/products/carla-cargo-trailer)! But, they have their own brake system for extra safety, and you can even get a motorized one to take some of the load off whatever bike you're pulling with. The loading area is 64 inches long. They offer a hitch adapter made specifically for Tern bikes - nice. The load limit is a bit more than others we've seen with the others here, at 440 pounds. 

The Carla Cargo trailers have 3 wheels - you can unhitch and use the trailer as a hand truck, then hitch back up and go home. That's neat! 

Here's some photos of [Tern HSDs in NYC towing Carla trailers](https://ohai.social/@dr2chase/111762564940960717), operated by Dutch Express. 

## [Wike](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/collections/cargo-trailers)
Wike, a Canadian brand, has a few different [cargo trailer options](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/collections/cargo-trailers), as well as some child trailers and most ineterestingly perhaps, some bike trailers for carrying adults in the ["special needs/adaptive trailers"](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/collections/special-needs) section.

Of interest for cargo are the [Kayak, Canoe and Surf Cart](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/products/kayak-cart-1) for your water adventures, a flatbed trailer of a similar size to the one Burley sells, a big [aluminum box trailer](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/products/cargo-landscaping-trailer), and a [DIY kit](https://wikeinc.com/en-ca/products/cargo-diy) to make your own custom flatbed cargo trailer. 

## [Thule Bike Trailers](https://www.thule.com/en-us/bike-trailers)
Thule makes some bike trailers. I'm undecided on if these should really count as "very big bike trailers", but decided to include them for now for completeness. If you want to haul kids or dogs by trailer, Thule is a popular, reliable brand. The "Reacha" line of trailers is more cargo-y, like the [Reacha Sport](https://www.thule.com/en-us/bike-trailers/bike-trailers-for-cargo/reacha-sport-_-10101403) you could use to carry a kayak. If you want the kind that can hold kids (or pets), your local online used marketplaces are a great place to look for Thule trailers, and you'll likely have more luck finding a used one local to you than anything else on this list.

## Specialty Cargo Add-Ons
These are a few things I've seen that offer additional cargo capacity for bikes. Some are provided by a particular bike brand and may not work at all with your bike, or may need some slight hacking to make work. Hopefully this will give you a jumping off point for research though if you want to haul any of these kinds of things! 

- [Yuba Ski Rack](https://yubabikes.com/product/ski-rack/) Out of stock as of 2025-09-02, but a friend reports he's seen these all over in Park City, Utah.
- [Yuba Surf's Up](https://yubabikes.com/product/surfs-up/) specifically for carrying surf boards on the Yuba Spicy Curry longtail. 
- [Cyclite Ski Rack](https://cyclite.cc/en/products/ski-rack-3) from Germany, seems like it would fit most regular bikes. 
- [Follow-me Tandem](https://trucavelo.com/products/followme-tandem-parent-child-bicycle-coupling-followme-tandem-atelage-pour-velo-suiveur): Couple a child's bicycle (12 to 20 inch wheels) to an adult bike; the child can sit on their bike to get where you're going, or not. Supports a max weight of 45kg (child + bicycle). Can be used with a rear rack or rear child seat still in place. I've heard from other families who bike that this is hands down the way to go when kids are starting to gain some bicycling independence, but not yet quite able to keep up with the speed or distance (or making decisions about street traffic) that parents can, including on adult e-bikes. 
- [Schleptastic Tow Monster](https://www.schleptastic.com/) to tow a kid's bike that they aren't going to ride to the destination. Compatible with a lot of different bikes/racks. Works with towed bike wheel sizes from 12 to 24 inches. Gallery shows people using it for hauling other things that aren't bikes, too.
