I've been on a bit of a self-help kick recently, thinking about concepts like minimalism, [[abundance]], and [consuming less](/blog/tags/consuming-less/). 

I've read a few so far, but have even more I'd like to read. Here's what's on my To-Read list for this topic.

## Already Read 

- [Your Money Or Your Life](/your-money-or-your-life/) which I wrote a post about. 
- [Essentialism](/essentialism/) which I wrote a post about. 
- _Nurture the Wow_ sort of fits here? I read it in 2022 while pregnant; it's by a Jewish Rabbi and is on the spirituality one might be able to find in the daily grind of caring for an infant or young child. I'm not Jewish, and didn't/don't consider myself super spiritual (I have a strong aversion to anything that might be considered "woo"), but I really liked reading this book. The concepts in it have really stuck with me, and I'd say it has had a huge impact on how I parent my kid-- not in any way you'd notice or my kid would notice necessarily, but more on how I feel internally while doing care work. 

## To Read Someday

- _Build the Life You Want_ by Arthur C Brooks & Oprah Winfrey. (Arthur writes for the Atlantic about happiness and I’ve enjoyed his stuff over the years. You know who Oprah is.)
- _The Lazy Genius Way_ (seems similar in approach to Essentialism or some of Ramit Sethi’s stuff-  focus on what you actually care about and forget the rest) Technically I put the "Lazy Genius" _Kitchen_ on my list and skipped the original one; I feel like that's covered by Ramit & _Essentialism_.
- _Four Thousand Weeks_ by Oliver Burkeman 
- _Start Where You Are_ by Pema Chödrön - Buddhist spirituality type stuff on dealing with the pain of life
	- See also _When Things Fall Apart_ by same
- _Mating in Captivity_ by Esther Perel - not really that topical to this subject really, more on sustaining desire in long-term romantic relationships
- _The Book of Joy_ - Dalai Lama & Desmond Tutu
- _Enchantment: Awakening Wonder in an Anxious Age_ by Katherine May - reawaken your sense of wonder & awe
	- see also _Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times_ by same
- _I Will Teach You To Be Rich_ by Ramit Sethi - I like what I've seen of Ramit's stuff (namely the Netflix show by the same name). He also has a podcast. “Rich” here is a bit of a red herring; he means managing your finances so that you spend on what is important to you and don’t waste money on things that are not that important to you. Before I quit Twitter, Ramit was on there sometimes talking about the need for increased housing supply. He believes renting or homeownership should both be considered valid options (and one isn't necessarily better than the other for everyone, forever). I like that.
- _The Longing for Less_ by Kyle Chayka - cultural analysis of how minimalism shows up in our culture and what that might mean
- _Digital Minimmalism_ by Cal Newport
- _The Power of Ritual_ by Casper ter Kuile - finding meaning and purpose through ordinary practices/daily rituals. Non-theist. (I was a fan of Casper’s work a decade-ish ago, through the podcast "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text"- what a particular era in my life and the world!)
- _The Overspent American_ by Juliet Schor is technically on the list, but as it's not available in e-book form, the chances I will read it are honestly pretty slim. I [wrote about it here](the-overspent-american/). 
	- Juliet was a co-author on _The Consumer Society Reader_, published in 2011, which is available on e-book!
- _Becoming Kin_ by Patty Krawec has been highly recommended to me. Drawing on Indigenous knowledge and wisdom, it asks "what might it look like to remember that we are all related?"

## In Progress
### _Needy_
 Deserving of a standalone shoutout, the book _Needy: How to Advocate for Your Needs and Claim Your Sovereignty_ by Mara Glatzel is _so good_. It’s fairly short, but to get the most out of it, you should take your time with it & actually do the journal prompts that are scattered throughout. I expected it to tell me something like “this is what to say to get your partner or your parents or your kids to respect your needs” but instead it is asking me to identify what my needs even are, and then it goes on to have the audacity to say I need to _prioritize my own needs_ through the things I do, rather than hoping other people will defend and meet my needs on my behalf. Rude!! But, a message I needed to hear.
