I am finally reading the book Burnout by Emily Nagoski & Amelia Nagoski. The key takeaway from what I've read so far (just the very beginning really) is that dealing with the stress (the physical stuff in your body caused by a stressful circumstance) and dealing with the stressor (the tight deadline or the sick family member of whatever) are different, and you have to do both. 

They say it is vital to "complete the cycle" of your stress response, ideally by spending 30 minutes _every single day_ doing something that helps. The #1 thing they say helps is annoyingly, physical exercise/moving your body. Other things that could help: physical affection (long hugs, cuddles, or kissing), casual pleasant chit-chat with acquaintances (the person in line at the grocery store counts), time with friends, creative self-expression (journaling, art, etc).
