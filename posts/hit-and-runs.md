Did you know 15% of *all* crashes between a car and a bike in Lincoln are classified by LPD hit & runs? And that 31% of bicyclists injured in Lincoln are children? 94% of cyclists who are hit are injured. That's in Lincoln, specifically.

Last week we saw [a pretty horrific video of a driver in Lincoln hitting a child on a bicycle, backing up and then dragging the child under the vehicle for 25 feet before driving off](http://lincolncrimestoppers.com/scary-moment/). The responding officer received cell-phone video the day it happened, which wasn't processed or released by LPD for nearly a month.

The officer who responded to this incredibly dangerous offense has responded to 9 bike-car crashes, and has never once ticketed a driver for failing to respect the right of the way of the person on a bike. Did bias cause a delay in processing and prioritization, meaning this clearly dangerous driver will likely stay on the streets unpunished?
